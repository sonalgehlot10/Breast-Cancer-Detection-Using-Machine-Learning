## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project was developed as my **final-year capstone project** during my Bachelorâ€™s in Information Technology.  
It focuses on building a predictive model that classifies breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using machine learning algorithms such as **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.  

The project includes a **web interface** that allows users to input clinical parameters and receive immediate predictions, integrating both the **ML model** and **web technologies** for accessibility and usability.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
This project was inspired by the growing potential of machine learning in healthcare and my curiosity about how models could assist in **medical diagnosis**.  
The goal wasnâ€™t to replace medical expertise but to **explore how data-driven models can support early detection and decision-making**.  
It also served as a way to apply what I had learned in data science, Python, and web development to a meaningful, real-world use case.
